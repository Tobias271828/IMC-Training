Privacy notice (from the 3rd of October 2024): I have developed the app in such a way that - as far as I know - the app does not send any user data anywhere. All your data remains on your device. This privacy notice can be changed at any time without having to inform you. Therefore, I kindly ask you to check it regularly. Changes might for example be made if new features require them. A synchronisation function for training in a team would for example require certain personal information to be sent over the internet. Since I neither have developed flutter and dart, nor kivy, python or any of the libraries or the dependencies needed for building the app, I will not take any responsibility if any personal information gets shared with someone. For more precise information, I kindly ask you to download the source code of the app and build it by yourself and carefully read through all licence, privacy or similar related notices or agreements of all the dependencies.
