This app is intended for training for the IMC (International Mathematics Competition for University Students). But it also serves just to have fun with old IMC problems. :)

Features include:
- Suggesting IMC problems for your training
- Looking up IMC problems quickly
- Mark IMC problems as solved so that they will not be suggested by the app anymore
- and more ...

For more information about the IMC problems and the IMC in general, please look at the IMC website (https://www.imc-math.org.uk/).

The app supports English, German, Dutch, Russian, Spanish and Swedish.

You can download the app from the Google Play Store. Alternatively, you can build the app from source by yourself. Be aware of the fact, that there was an old version (version number <= 2.4) which is located in the App directory. The new version can be found in the imctraining directory.

This app is Open Source and licenced under the GPL-3.0-or-later licence. The source code can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/Tobias271828/IMC-Training/). This app is written in flutter and dart and more (the licensing and copyright notices can be found in the imctraining/licenses.json file in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Tobias271828/IMC-Training/). Many thanks to the developers of those projects!

Many thanks to Jakob Feldner, Jonathan Frey, Veronika KÃ¶rber and Barbara Roos for their great support in LaTeX-typing, but also Bug-testing and suggesting new functionalities for the app!

If you want to report a bug or a typo or if you want to provide a translation of the app into another language, please contact me via email, please write to imctrainingapp.g8199@slmails.com (to prevent spam, this is an email alias, which is linked to my main email inbox).

Privacy notice (from the 9rd of October 2024): I have developed the app in such a way that - as far as I know - the app does not send any user data anywhere. All your data remains on your device. This privacy notice can be changed at any time without having to inform you. Therefore, I kindly ask you to check it regularly. Changes might for example be made if new features require them. A synchronisation function for training in a team would for example require certain personal information to be sent over the internet. Since I neither have developed flutter and dart, nor kivy, python or any of the libraries or the dependencies needed for building the app, I will not take any responsibility if any personal information gets shared with someone. For more precise information, I kindly ask you to download the source code of the app and build it by yourself and carefully read through all licence, privacy or similar related notices or agreements of all the dependencies.


Up to today, there is no iOS-version available. Flutter/Dart works cross-platform, so iOS-builds should be possible. If you want to build an iOS-version of the app, feel free to fork the repository and contact the developer.
