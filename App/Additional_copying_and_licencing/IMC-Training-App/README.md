This app is intended for training for the IMC (International Mathematics Competition for University Students). But it also serves just to have fun with old IMC problems :)

Features include:
- Suggesting IMC problems for your training
- Looking up IMC problems quickly
- Mark IMC problems as solved so that they will not be suggested by the app anymore
- and more ...

For more information about the IMC problems and the IMC in general, please look at the IMC website (https://www.imc-math.org.uk/).

The app supports English and German.

You can download the app from the Google Play Store or download the apk file from the App/bin folder on GitHub (https://github.com/Tobias314159/IMC-Training/). Alternatively, you can build the app from source yourself.

This app is Open Source and licenced under the GPL-3.0-or-later licence. The source code can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/Tobias314159/IMC-Training/). This app is written in kivy and python and uses furthermore SDL2, SDL_mixer, docutils, pygments, glew, gstreamer, sjpeg and more (the licensing and copyright notices can be found in the App/Additional_copying_and_licencing folder in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Tobias314159/IMC-Training/). Many thanks to the developers of those projects!

Many thanks to Barbara Roos, Jonathan Frey and Jakob Feldner for their great support in LaTeX-typing, but also Bug-testing and suggesting new functionalities for the App!

If you want to report a bug or a typo or want to contact me (the developer, Tobias Schnieders) for another reason, please write an email to imctrainingapp.g8199@slmails.com (to prevent spam, this is an email alias, that is linked to my main email inbox).

Privacy Notice (from the 14th August 2024): I have developed the app in such a way that - as far as I know - the app does not send any user data anywhere. All your data remains on your device. This privacy notice can be changed at any time without having to inform you. Therefore, I kindly ask you to check it regularly. Changes might for example be made if new features require them. A synchronisation function for training in a team would for example require certain personal information to be send over the internet. Since I have not developed kivy, python or the libraries or the dependencies needed for building the app, I will not take any responsibility if any personal information got shared with anyone, since I do not know how they work. If you want to know more about this, I kindly ask you to download the source code of the app and build it yourself and carefully read through all licence, privacy or similar related notices or agreements of all the dependencies.

FAQ:
- Why is there no iOS-version available?
Kivy works cross-platform. Therefore iOS-builds should be possible. If you want to build an iOS-version of the app, feel free to fork the repository and contact the developer.
- What is the feature called "Mike's training"?
Mike's training is a special feature that is only designed to be used together with the IMC training material from Mike (a great IMC team leader, from whoom I learned a lot). If you do not know him, please just ignore this feature.
